 * needs no params, so a key held in a variable typed by a union of those keys
 * renders too: TypeScript matches an object against a union of more than 25
 * members by discriminant only. It also takes the keys without a payload,
 * which a required trailing param of the parser keeps out of the first set.
 *
 * TypeScript finds a key's member by a lookup instead of trying every member
 * only when each key names one member and the members are object types, not
 * intersections. So a key without a payload has no member of its own, and
 * every other member is flattened. The member of the keys without params
 * stays an intersection: as an object type, its `params` could become what
 * the lookup goes by.
